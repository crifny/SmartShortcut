 SmartShortcut for Windows

 This program is used to generate a customized shortcut window in ".jar" format.
 JRE/JDK is needed.

 1. A generated jar file is not recommended to be placed directly on desktop.
    Shortcut to the jar file with a customized icon is a beautiful way.
 2. Do not remove the image files linked with jar files.
 3. ".bat" files should be placed at the same directory of their linked jar file.
 4. "embed.jar" is a subset of "org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86-4.3.jar".
 5. Button icons are stored at $USRER_HOME$/smartshortcut/.
